Overveiw: The system is designed to handle creation and approval of travel ticket bookings by asking users to input their personal information, select services, calculate total charges and determine the approval status. basic statistics are also generated by the system. The code is fully functional and does its work but it can always be modified, made clean or more flexible in future.

Steps in the code: 
Global couonter: The global ticket_counter helps to generate a unique Id each time starting from 20000.
Making a booking: The ticketbooking class is made to collect customers details to run the whole process.
Extra services: choose_services is made to allow the users to choose the additional services as per their requirement.
Getting approval: approve_booking is made to approve or reject the request. if the total is under $300 the request is approved and a approval reference number is given whereas if it is more than $300 the request is not approved.
Final output: after all the bookings are done the syatem will show details and statistics.

Design Principle Overveiw:
KISS: The passenger information is collected twicw it can be improved by combining into one method.
DRY: the same code appears in multiple places it can be improved by reusing logic .
OPEN/CLOSED PRINCIPLE: the approval rules are hardcoded and it can be improved by making the rules easy to change without editing the code.
SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY: One class is handling everything, it can be split into separate parts to make it easy.
SEPARATIONS OF CONCERNS: everything is mixed together like input, output and process. breaking them down into separate sections can make it easier.
CLEARITY OVER CLEVERNESS: The code isnt confusing and mostly clear.
REFACTOR OFTEN: Some parts of code are doing to much breaking the big methods into smaller methods can help.
AVOID PREMATURE OPTIMIZATION: There is no unnecessary performance.

Limitations of the code:
The passenger information is entered mor ethan one time.
The rules are hardcoded, approval criteria can't be changed easily.
No validations for wrong formats or empty feilds is provided.
By bundling everything into one class, it is hard to make changes.

Conclusion: 
The ticket booking system is fully functional and successfully guides the users through whole process. It shows basic programming skills really well, it can be modified and updated to make it easy to maintain. Some changes like,
Reusing logic instead to copying the code
making different classes for different inputs
breaking down big methods into smaller
can really help to improve the code, make it easy to maintain and less confusing and reflecting real-world development making it a strong base for advanced applications.
